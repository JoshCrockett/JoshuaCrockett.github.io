summary: "A database created to help learn how to work with objects."
---
This is a project that I worked on in my Object Oriented Programming class. It was a project where we were designing database themed around a theorhetical farm in CLion. We were tasked with implementing objects for Animals, Weight, and Capacity for the barn.

The point of doing this project was to get us to gain more of a further understanding of C++, object oriented programming, and even github to some degree. The project would be uploaded to a class repository where were were also tasked with managing branches - the main branch that held information for the Animals and a side branch where the Capacity and Weight would be stored. Finally, it would essentially serve as a way of introducing us to crucial subjects in C, with Weight and Capacity both serving as an introduction to the idea of linked lists.
