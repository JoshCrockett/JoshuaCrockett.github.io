*How simple changes in phrasing can drastically affect answers.*

Asking questions is important. This holds true not only in engineering but also in life. Because of this, the ability to construct a well-formulated question is a very valuable skill to have, as it allows people to get help that subsequently solves whatever they were pondering. However, the thing to note about questions is that there are many ways they can be constructed to be more effective. That is where the distinction between "smart" and "dumb" questions is made.

Eric S. Raymond, author of *The Cathedral and The Bazaar*, once wrote an essay about this very distinction—*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*—and went into detail about specific habits people exhibit when asking questions on Stack Overflow that may potentially discredit or warp others’ perceptions of them. A lot of the advice offered in this essay is seemingly straightforward: "Be explicit about your questions," "Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework," "Volume is not precision," etc. Even if some of these tips may seem obvious, people on Stack Overflow often fall into a few pitfalls that may invite negative responses. This negative response is likely one reason why ChatGPT has started to rise in popularity in the context of asking questions—AI will always remain neutral, if not outright positive. However, I personally believe that in spite of its rise, it is absolutely worth looking at examples of good and inadequate questions, if only because, to quickly circle back to the opening statement, knowing how to ask a question properly is a valuable skill to have.

As such, let us now look at examples of questions, both good and poor, as a way to further reflect on this skill. We will be using other principles from the aforementioned *How To Ask Questions The Smart Way* as a means of evaluating them.

For now, let's begin with the smart question.

## A Smart Question

## An Inadequate Question
