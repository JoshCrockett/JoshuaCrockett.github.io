<div style="text-align: center;">
  How standardized coding can help further develop coding skills.
</div>

At this point in time, I've now completed a week's worth of coding with ESLint and VSCode. I've worked with both individually in the past, but it's always been to a more shallow level compared to here. As such, it's viable to have new impressions when working with these tools, because they are being used in differing ways compared to what I'm normally used to.
  
## First Impressions

## Is linting... fun?

The first example we will look at today is [one of the most upvoted questions asked on Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely). When looking at this question, I believe that it is an example of a good question. There are a variety of reasons why I think it is; It's straightforward and to the point. There isn't any filler words added that make the question bloated. There's documented evidence as to what was already done, and a clear call to action on what needs to be done. The fact that this question is so good is also directly reflected in the comments - most of the top answers are extremely helpful, and professional, polite, like people there want to help out and genuinely answer the question. This final point is an important distinguisher to me, regarding whether or not a question is good or not - ultimately the point of asking a question is to get an answer that's helpful, and if there aren't any answers that are given that are helpful, chances are that the question is not good. Now, we will move onto a less adequate question.
